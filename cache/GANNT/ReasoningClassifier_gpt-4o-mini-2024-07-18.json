This indicates that there is a mechanism in place for managing tasks and their relationships with resources (in this case, people).\n\nThe connection between the two requirements lies in the fact that deleting a person (from (1)) would likely require the system to also handle the deletion or adjustment of tasks associated with that person (as mentioned in (2)). The mention of dependencies in (1) suggests that the deletion of a person would impact tasks, which are managed in (2).\n\nTherefore, there is a traceability link between the two artifacts, as they both deal with the management of resources (people) and tasks, and the actions described in (1) would necessitate actions described in (2).\n\n<trace>yes</trace>","e31b76c9-6be2-37f4-8572-95133663d9cb":"To determine if there is a traceability link between the two artifacts, we need to analyze their content and intent.\n\n(1) states that a new task should have a start date and an end date, indicating that tasks are defined by these time constraints.
