This requirement implies that there are dependencies between people and tasks in the system.\n\n(2) mentions that when a task is deleted, the GanttProject class calls AdjustTaskBoundsAlgorithm and passes the parent of the deleted task as a parameter. This indicates that there is a relationship between tasks and their parents, which is consistent with the requirement mentioned in (1). Specifically, the requirement states that dependencies to all tasks the person is supposed to work on should be deleted when deleting a person, which implies that there are dependencies between people and tasks in the system.\n\nTherefore, we can infer that there is a traceability link between (1) and (2), as they both mention dependencies between people and tasks in the system.","bb3dfe03-705c-3c10-8347-4392704751db":"\n<trace>yes</trace>.\n\nThe two artifacts are related because they both deal with deleting resources in a software system. The first requirement mentions deleting a person and all its associated information such as dependencies to tasks the person is supposed to work on, which is similar to the second requirement that mentions deleting a task from the Calendar by calling the delete method of the GanttProject class and supplying the TaskId parameter. Both artifacts are related because they both involve deleting resources in some way.","d6a28b59-1a86-3d99-8b08-8ff34e829d00":"<trace>yes</trace>.\n\nThere is a traceability link between (1) and (2). In (1), we see that there are requirements for maintaining resource properties, including name and holidays. In (2), we see that the human resource class contains these same properties, as well as phone, email, and functions to set and get them. Additionally, the class provides a way to represent holidays, which is also mentioned in (1). This suggests that there is a direct connection between the two requirements, as they both relate to maintaining resource properties and their associated data.","20a9ea87-59a2-3529-96bc-4c6fd1049f4b":"<trace>yes</trace>.\nThere is a traceability link between these two artifacts because they both relate to the same requirement, which is to maintain resource properties.

The first artifact, (1), provides a description of the properties that a resource can have, including holidays.

The first requirement mentions that \"Tasks can be linked with one another to indicate the sequence in which they have to be performed.\" This implies that the system should allow users to create links between tasks, which will help them to visualize the dependencies between tasks.\n\nThe second requirement further clarifies this by stating that \"The fact of linking of one task to another should be captured as dependency between two tasks.\" This means that the system should capture the link between two tasks and represent it as a dependency relationship between them.\n\nTherefore, there is a traceability link between (1) and (2), as they both describe the same requirement of allowing users to create links between tasks and capturing those links as dependencies between tasks.","40a78c16-1270-36ff-9256-916c5a59d0aa":"\nBased on the given requirements, there appears to be a traceability link between (1) and (2).

The two requirements are related because they both involve changes in the sequence of tasks.

In the second requirement, when the start or end date of a task is changed, the start or end dates of its subtasks must also change accordingly. This means that if there are any links between tasks, those links will need to be updated as well. Therefore, these two requirements are related and can be traced back to each other."}
