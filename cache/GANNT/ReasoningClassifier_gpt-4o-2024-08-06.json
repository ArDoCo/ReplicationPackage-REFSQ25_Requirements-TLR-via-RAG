This requirement focuses on the conceptual aspect of what a task is and its basic attributes.\n\n2. Requirement (2) describes the technical implementation details of creating a new task. It specifies that a TaskManager object is used in the class constructor to handle the creation of a task, and it mentions the involvement of the ResourceAssignmentCollection class for resource allocation.\n\nBoth requirements are related to the creation of a new task. Requirement (1) provides a high-level description of what a task is and its attributes, while requirement (2) provides a more detailed, technical description of how a task is created and managed in the system. The mention of resource allocation in requirement (2) aligns with the concept of resources completing tasks in requirement (1).\n\nGiven this analysis, there is a traceability link between the two requirements as they both pertain to the creation and management of tasks within the system, albeit at different levels of abstraction.\n\n<trace>yes</trace>","adfcb289-c384-3731-a8da-33468e4d3619":"To determine if there is a traceability link between the two requirements, we need to analyze their content and see if they are related or if one is derived from the other.\n\n1.

This is also a functional requirement, but it focuses on the user interface aspect, ensuring that users have a way to perform the deletion action through the GUI.\n\nBoth requirements are related to the deletion of resources (persons) from a project. Requirement (1) describes the backend functionality needed to delete a person and their associated data, while requirement (2) describes the frontend functionality needed to allow users to perform this action through the GUI.\n\nThe traceability link between these two requirements is that they both address different aspects of the same functionality: deleting a person from a project.
