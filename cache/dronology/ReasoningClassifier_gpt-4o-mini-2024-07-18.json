This implies that the _GCSMiddleware_ acts as an intermediary that takes commands from a higher-level system (Dronology) and sends them to the _GCS_.\n\n(2) specifies that the _GCS_ must transform these commands into a vehicle-specific format. This indicates that the _GCS_ has a role in processing the commands it receives, which are presumably the same commands forwarded by the _GCSMiddleware_.\n\nThe link between the two requirements can be established through the flow of commands: (1) describes the forwarding of commands to the _GCS_, and (2) describes what happens to those commands once they reach the _GCS_. Therefore, the two requirements are related in that they describe different aspects of the same process involving command handling.\n\nBased on this analysis, there is a traceability link between the two artifacts.\n\n<trace>yes</trace>"}
