It implies a need for the API to be flexible and adaptable to different use cases.\n\n(2) requirement: \"The interfaces in libwarc shall ensure that any changes to the library, will not affect any tool or application based on libwarc.\"\n\nThis requirement emphasizes the importance of maintaining backward compatibility within the libwarc library. It ensures that updates or modifications to the library do not negatively impact tools or applications that rely on it.\n\nWhile both requirements are related to the functionality and maintainability of the system, they address different aspects:\n\n- (1) focuses on the API's capabilities and flexibility.\n- (2) emphasizes the need for stability and compatibility within the libwarc library.\n\nGiven their distinct focus areas, there isn't a direct traceability link between these two requirements.

This requirement focuses specifically on the handling of read operations, which is part of managing access as mentioned in FR 19.\n\nGiven this analysis, there appears to be a relationship between the two requirements because SRS 15 directly addresses one aspect of what FR 19 requires: managing read access.
