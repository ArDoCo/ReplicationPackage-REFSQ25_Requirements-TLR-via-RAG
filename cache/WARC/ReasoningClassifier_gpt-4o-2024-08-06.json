Requirement (1) focuses on the iteration aspect, while requirement (2) focuses on memory management. These two aspects are often interrelated in software systems, especially when dealing with data processing. Efficient iteration over records often requires careful memory management to ensure performance and prevent memory leaks or other issues.\n\nGiven that both requirements pertain to the processing of WARC records and involve different but complementary aspects of handling these records, there is a logical connection between them. The iterator functionality (requirement 1) would likely need to rely on the memory management capabilities (requirement 2) to function correctly and efficiently.\n\nTherefore, there is a traceability link between these two requirements as they are both part of the broader functionality of handling WARC records in the system.\n\n<trace>yes</trace>","6078142c-79f6-3945-9d45-b52d5d3e35dd":"To determine if there is a traceability link between the two artifacts, we need to analyze the content and purpose of each requirement.\n\n1.

Additionally, it mentions the creation of an abstract WARC-document as a simple container.\n\nBoth requirements involve the concept of an iterator for WARC records. The key difference is that requirement (1) focuses on handling WARC-type records, while requirement (2) emphasizes a generic iterator that can iterate over all WARC records and facilitate the creation of an abstract WARC-document.\n\nThe overlap in functionality (iterating over WARC records) suggests that there is a traceability link between these two requirements.

Requirement (1) suggests a mechanism (plug-in interface) to incorporate various compression libraries, which could be directly related to the ability mentioned in Requirement (2) to support compressed WARC-records. Essentially, the plug-in interface from Requirement (1) could be a means to achieve the support for compressed records as described in Requirement (2).\n\nTherefore, there is a logical connection between the two requirements: the plug-in interface for alternative compression libraries (Requirement 1) could be a way to fulfill the need to support compressed WARC-records (Requirement 2).\n\n<trace>yes</trace>","76391747-dfe6-33c5-90f3-0c5804270c58":"To determine if there is a traceability link between the two artifacts, we need to analyze the content and intent of each requirement.\n\n1. **Artifact (1):** \"FR 23 - WARC Browser shall support a proxy-style interface\"\n   - This requirement specifies that the WARC Browser must have a proxy-style interface.
