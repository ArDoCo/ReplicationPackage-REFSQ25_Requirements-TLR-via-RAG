The first requirement, FR 3, states that Libwarc shall provide a range of functions for creating each type of valid WARC-record, which is an essential aspect of ensuring that the resulting WARC files conform to the prevailing WARC standard. The second requirement, SRS 67, specifies that Libwarc shall be implemented according to WARC v0.17, which is a specific version of the WARC standard.
