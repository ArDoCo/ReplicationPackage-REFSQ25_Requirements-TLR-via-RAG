Create new Flight Route

"Upon user request a new empty flight route is created:    When the “Add a New Route” button is clicked  a modal window pops up and asks users to input the name for the new route. Two buttons are displayed on the window:    - “Cancel” to cancel adding the route  - “Draw Route” to add a new route  auto-select the route  and enter the Editing Mode."
