Create abstract base class for WGS-84 position classes

"Everyone should get to work with the position class that they are most comfortable with. And to enable everyone to get the most out of the position classes  distance functions should be provided to all classes. That is what motivates this abstract base class.    The class should have these methods:    laser Distance (that takes another WGS-84 position) -> returns a double  travel distance(that takes another WGS-84 position) -> returns a double  toNvector() -> returns an NVector  toPVector() -> returns a PVector  toLlaCoordinate() -> returns an LlaCoordinate  toRotMatrix() -> returns a matrix that can take displacement vectors from ECEF and rotate them into NED vectors"
