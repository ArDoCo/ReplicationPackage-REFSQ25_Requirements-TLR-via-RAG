A class to hold p-vectors (X  Y  and Z coordinates in the WGS-84 ref. frame)

"We need an immutable class holding three doubles for X  Y  and Z in the WGS-84 reference frame.    Here is some background information about the WGS-84 reference frame:    * The origin of this frame is at the center of mass of the Earth  * The X-axis points towards where the equator meets the prime meridean (latitude 0  longitude 0)  * The Z-axis points towards the geographic north pole (latitude 90  longitude undefined)  * The Y-axis can be derived using right hand rule and points towards latitude 0  longitude 90    This class should have the following instance fields:  * x - the position along the X-axis in meters  * y - the position along the Y-axis in meters  * z - the position along the Z-axis in meters    This class should have the following methods:  * toLla - takes no arguments and returns the latitude  longitude  and altitude for this position  * toNvec - takes no arguments and returns the n-vector plus altitude for this position"
